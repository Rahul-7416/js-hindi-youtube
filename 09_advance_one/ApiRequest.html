// Doubt Section: Solved and cleared by chatGpt

// Q. but why we are calling the processData function only when the readystate === 4, why can't we console.log(data) in the global scope ?

// ANSWER:

// The reason for checking `xhr.readyState === 4` before accessing and processing the data is related to the asynchronous nature of the XMLHttpRequest. The `readyState` property represents the state of the request, and it goes through multiple stages before reaching the final state of 4, which indicates that the operation is complete.

// Here's what each `readyState` value represents:

// - `0`: `UNSENT` - The request has not been opened.
// - `1`: `OPENED` - The request has been opened but has not been sent.
// - `2`: `HEADERS_RECEIVED` - The request has been sent, and headers and status are available.
// - `3`: `LOADING` - The response is being received (partial data).
// - `4`: `DONE` - The operation is complete.

// When you check `xhr.readyState === 4`, you ensure that the XMLHttpRequest has reached its final state (`DONE`). This is crucial because it guarantees that the response has been fully received, and you can safely access and process the data.

// If you were to log `data` in the global scope without checking the `readyState`, it might lead to issues because the code would attempt to access `data` before the asynchronous operation is complete. The `onreadystatechange` event is triggered multiple times as the request progresses through its different states. By checking for `readyState === 4`, you ensure that the data is only accessed and processed when it's fully available.

// In summary, it's a best practice to wait for the `readyState` to be `4` before working with the data received from the server, ensuring that the asynchronous operation has completed successfully.
